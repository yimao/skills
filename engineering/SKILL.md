description: Create professional engineering diagrams using drawio XML format with industry-standard symbols. Best for electrical schematics, P&ID (Piping & Instrumentation), rack diagrams, fault tree analysis, PLC ladder logic, and logic gate diagrams. Built on drawio with engineering-specific stencils. NOT for simple flowcharts (use mermaid) or network topology (use network skill).

# Engineering Diagram Generator

**Quick Start:** Choose diagram type → Add symbols from stencil library → Connect with appropriate lines → Add labels/annotations → Wrap in ` ```drawio ` fence.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use ` ```drawio ` code fence. NEVER use ` ```xml ` — it will NOT render as a diagram.

## Critical Rules

> 🔗 **This is a drawio-derived skill.** All structure, layout, and edge routing rules inherit from [drawio SKILL.md](../drawio/SKILL.md). Read the base rules first.

**Engineering-specific additions:**
- Check [stencils/README.md](../drawio/stencils/README.md) for exact symbol names (e.g., `mxgraph.electrical.resistors.resistor_1`)
- Symbol colors: Black(`#000000`) for schematic, Blue(`#0000FF`) for pneumatic, Green(`#00FF00`) for hydraulic
