description: Create network topology diagrams using drawio XML format with industry-standard device icons. Best for LAN/WAN diagrams, enterprise networks, cloud infrastructure, and vendor-specific diagrams (Cisco, Arista, Fortinet). Built on drawio with specialized network stencils. NOT for abstract dependency graphs (use graphviz) or simple flowcharts (use mermaid).

# Network Topology Diagram Generator

**Quick Start:** Choose topology type → Add network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) → Connect with appropriate link types → Add labels and zones → Wrap in ` ```drawio ` fence.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always use ` ```drawio ` code fence. NEVER use ` ```xml ` — it will NOT render as a diagram.

## Critical Rules

> 🔗 **This is a drawio-derived skill.** All structure, layout, and edge routing rules inherit from [drawio SKILL.md](../drawio/SKILL.md). Read the base rules first.

**Network-specific additions:**
- Check [stencils/README.md](../drawio/stencils/README.md) for exact device stencil names (e.g., `mxgraph.cisco.routers.router`)
- Device stencils require `fillColor`/`strokeColor`; edge/link stencils (e.g., `mxgraph.networks.comm_link`) do NOT
- Use `fillColor=none;` for network zones/segments to avoid covering child devices
